JSBoilerplate
========================
JSBoilerplate is a collection of scripts that I like to use when starting a project form scratch.

Mediator pattern
------------------------
JSBoilerplate is based around the Mediator pattern. The Mediator objects sits in between all classes in the project. Classes can not talk to each other directly, everything goes through the Mediator.
